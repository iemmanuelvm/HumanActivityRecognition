# HumanActivityRecognition
### Human Activity Recognition for Machine Learning
### Here we implement machine learning algorithms to detect human activity, we classify 6 six types of activities. The algorithms we implemented were:
#### Logistic Regression
#### K-Nearest Neighbhors
#### Random Forest
#### Support Vector Machine
#### Multi Layer Perceptron
### The algorithms previous is applied GridSearch to perform all combination to adjust hyperparameters.
### The metrics we used to evaluate performance were:
#### Accuracy
#### AUC-ROC
#### F1-Score
#### Recall
